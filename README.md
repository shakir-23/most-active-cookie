# Most Active Cookie

This project uses Java and JUnit along with a bash script to meet the requirements. With more time, I would likely use Spring or some other build framework.

The test cases (in JUnit) can be executed with the following command:

```./cookie_test```

The program itself can be executed with the following command:

```./most_active_cookie [filename] [-d] [date]```
